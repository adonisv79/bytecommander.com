        <h2>Are you an SSS contributor?</h2>
        <p className="mx-2 my-4">As someone who (is forced to) subscribe to the SSS (Socialist Slavery Scam), it is good to be aware of what this product does and where your money actualy goes. Spoiler alert! it goes into the pockets of some private institution and its investors who lobbied the government to do this.</p>
        <p className="mx-2 my-4">Oftentimes, this product is being propagandised as a way for Filipinos to get more from their &quot;nasty and greedy&quot; employers to the benefit of the employee for their retirement. However, this is nothing more than a lie to tap into the greed and lazy desires of several employees specialy those in the lower tiers of the society.</p>
        <p className="mx-2 my-4">First, know that there no difference between this from some employments in the past. Some employers before forced part of their employees earnings into retirement funds held by the company. While the employee can claim on this retirement fund (or not if they did something undesireable by the owners of the company), it allows the company to utilize the employee&apos;s held salary for their business operations (similar to taking a free loan from an employee which you do not need to payback until they retire! and at 0% interest? what an awesome deal!).</p>
        <p className="mx-2 my-4">Second, while the idea that &quot;employers are being punished to pay employees more&quot; seems like a dream for most bad employees, they do not realize that this too is the very reason why investors do not like to invest in the country (causing lesser opportunities) while those who can do the math, actualy has already deducted this from what they can actually offer Filipinos. (ex: If I have a budget to pay filipinos PHP20,000 for a basic role, but its government makes me pay all these stuffs for like PHP8,000 as a &quot;cost of employing Filipinos&quot;, then do not be surprised that filipinos are presented with minimum wage opportunities of PHP12,000 while their rival countries are paid more after currency conversion.)</p>
        <p className="mx-2 my-4">And lastly, ask any retiree how SSS was sold to them and I can asure you that it is always sold as a product that reinvests their contributions that grows so that once they retire they can have a comfortable life from their &quot;loyalty to the system&quot;. Then ask them how much are they getting now monthly as a retiree and have a good laugh.</p>

          <li>ER (Employment Ransom) - The amount deducted from the employment opportunity. Also known as cost of employing a Filipino that the Socialist institution takes as ransom. Employers deduct this from their budget to hire people to come out with an offer. I can pay a Filipino 20,000 monthly for example but thanks to my ER of 1,900, I give them 18,100 as a basic pay.</li>
          <li>EE (Employee Exploitation) - The amount propagandaized to employee minded people as &quot;The only amount they paid&quot; to make it appear that they paid little but will get a big payout later after retirement. In reality they paid everything as an &quot;opportunity cost&quot;</li>
          <li>TTL - Total amount (Monthly/Anually) that could have been utilized by the employee monthly for other important needs to uplift themselves from poverty.</li>

        <h3>Monthly Pension of retirees now (try not to laugh)</h3>
        The goal of pensions is for people to afford the &quot;COST FOR LIVING&quot;. The fact you are still alive, there is an upkeep needed like food, shelter, medicine and clothing. In today&apos;s society, one cannot live a decent life without earning monthly the following minimum amounts.
        <ul className="list-disc p-6">
          <li>PHP6,000 Food - approximating PHP200 per day on food for 30 days. </li>
          <li>PHP5,000 Shelter - average monthly rental price for someone living in a very small appartment in the slums. </li>
          <li>PHP2,000 Medicine - approximating monthly medical expense on your retirement age (unless you no longer care and are happy to expire in your sleep)</li>
          <li>PHP500 Clothing - Small budget for clothing, shoes, socks, etc. needed unless you want to wear the same shirt all year </li>
          <li>PHP13,500 Total -  This is the amount the loyal retirees funding their SSS must be getting now</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Actual numbers</h4>
        <p className="mx-2 my-4">So wow! that is a lot! as an average responsible and educated worker losing PHP2,800 monthly opportunity cost for this, would be great that after 38 years of working (you would be 60 and unhirable then), after losing an approximated total of PHP1,276,800... getting a retirement of PHP15,000 per month is not a bad deal (if you live beyond another 10 years that is which the SSS org hopes does not happen. Life expectancy of men tend to be in the 60s on average afterall)</p>
        <p className="mx-2 my-4">So, out of the generosity of the SSS scam organization you get...</p>
        <ul className="list-disc p-6">
          <li>PHP1,200 monthly if the member has 120 months contribution or at least ten (10) CYS</li>
          <li>PHP2,400 monthly if the member has 240 months contribution or at least twenty (20) CYS</li>
          <li>SRC: https://www.sss.gov.ph/sss/DownloadContent?fileName=SUMMARY_OF_BENEFITS.pdf</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mx-2 my-4">
          So what does this mean? CYS (Credited Years of Service) means an enitre year or 12 monthly payments. Anything below 120 years of payment and you claim nothing.
          Going beyond 120 years does not have any effect as nothing is prorated and you will only get to the next level once you reached the threshold of getting 240 CYS or 20 years.
          But we paid like almost 1.2 Million pesos for 35 years you say? LOL!!! well if you can live till another 42 years (1.2m divided by 2400 pesos divided by 12 months per year) you have broken even :D
        </p>
        <p className="mx-2 my-4">
          The scam is that we all know that the contribution is a pyramid like structure where majority cannot make the sweet spot of exactly paying the years needed. A lot will overpay as they go up but the volume lessens to the top. Majority will only be able to comply as employment is unstable in the country which renders people moving job to job and most would end up skipping on being regularized to pay their contributions. This means a majority of Filipnos will have no claim to their contributions and for most who did manage to go beyond 10 years, they might fall short to reach the 20 year requirement just to get to the next level.
