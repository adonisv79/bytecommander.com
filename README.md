This project is the official site of Adonis Lee Villamor (Me). It contains some of the latest sample codes I work on and provide freely for the sake of knowledge share and of course showing people interested to work with me on how I do my coding. Feel free to browse to my codes and reuse as you like. But do be professional to refer to me if you do. Anyway enjoy!

In this initial version, I created a Reversi game based entirely on ReactJS that can be played on a browser. If you do not know that game please check out Wikipedia for the rules.

## ReactJS
This code base is built on ReactJS so in order to run locally
