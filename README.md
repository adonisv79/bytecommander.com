## History

* 2023-04 - We have moved this codebase to utilize NextJS 13. With our interest in react more than Vue or Angular and needing a better way to do react with SEO, Next.JS seems to be the best way forward. We are also supposed to utilize Material UI as it was before but it seems NextJS (though compatible with material) ships with Tailwind as recommendation. We can use them side by side but why complicate things??? Lets learn the recommendations for this framework before jumping into more frankenstein experiments like before.

* 2023-03 - this project has not been brushed up for years. need to reanalize old codes as it seems to have several deprecated dependencies and would not build properly. This is one of the reason NodeJS projects are frustrating which reminds me of DLL Hell but on steroids.

* 2020-03 Started working on a javascript game engine concept from scratch. Prototype game concept based on flappybird.

* 2020-02 Project have started. Utilized the lates React, material-UI and AirBnb eslint. Created the Reversi game as a fun project
